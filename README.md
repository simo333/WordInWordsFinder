Word In Words Finder
Console program that finds all words that can be built with key word's chars.

How to use:
* you need a dictionary file (best choice is with .txt extension) with words in any language (one word per line)
* in the beginning the program will ask you for your dictionary file (absolute path preferred). For polish words you can use "polish-words.txt" that is in project's directory
* next step is to type a key word that will be analyzed
* found words will be saved as "znalezione-slowa.txt" in project's directory
